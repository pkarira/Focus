# Focus
Several times our addiction to social media distracts us from our main aim . People are found spending hours on these websites . This chrome extension has a unique feature which allows user to set interval between closing and opening instances of a particular website . 
It inhibits from opening same website in a very short intervals and helps in focusing on work . Lets suppose you have a habbit of 
opening facebook or any other website after every 5-10 minutes then this may help u . Suppose u set time interval of facebook as 1 hour in 
this chrome extension and after u close facebook's tab the it will not let you open facebook for next one hour . Once time interval of one hour gets 
over u can open facebook and again after spending some time on facebook now are shifting to some profitable work , you close your tab and again you not be open it for next one hour . This way you 
can just concentrate on your work .

<h3>USP</h3>
As mentioned above this extenson allows you set interval of closing and opening of same website , other site blockers either block your website 
indefinitely or allows you set time limit to your usage in a day but this is not a case with this extension , you can spend as much time on website as you want
and once you close your tab then you will not be able to open it for saved time interval .
